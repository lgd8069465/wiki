Remote host reachability check succeeded.
The following hosts are reachable: 192.168.2.15 192.168.2.213 192.168.2.53.
The following hosts are not reachable: .
All hosts are reachable. Proceeding further...
The script will setup SSH connectivity from the host docker to all
the remote hosts. After the script is executed, the user can use SSH to run
commands on the remote hosts or copy files between this host docker
and the remote hosts without being prompted for passwords or confirmations.

NOTE 1:
As part of the setup procedure, this script will use ssh and scp to copy
files between the local host and the remote hosts. Since the script does not
store passwords, you may be prompted for the passwords during the execution of
the script whenever ssh or scp is invoked.

NOTE 2:
AS PER SSH REQUIREMENTS, THIS SCRIPT WILL SECURE THE USER HOME DIRECTORY
AND THE .ssh DIRECTORY BY REVOKING GROUP AND WORLD WRITE PRIVILEDGES TO THESE
directories.

Do you want to continue and let the script make the above mentioned changes (yes/no)?
yes

The user chose yes
Please specify if you want to specify a passphrase for the private key this script will create for the local host. Passphrase is used to encrypt the private key and makes SSH much more secure. Type 'yes' or 'no' and then press enter. In case you press 'yes', you would need to enter the passphrase whenever the script executes ssh or scp. 
The estimated number of times the user would be prompted for a passphrase is 6. In addition, if the private-public files are also newly created, the user would have to specify the passphrase on one additional occasion. 
Enter 'yes' or 'no'.
yes

The user chose yes

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verifying SSH setup
===================
The script will now run the date command on the remote nodes using ssh
to verify if ssh is setup correctly. IF THE SETUP IS CORRECTLY SETUP,
THERE SHOULD BE NO OUTPUT OTHER THAN THE DATE AND SSH SHOULD NOT ASK FOR
PASSWORDS. If you see any output other than date or are prompted for the
password, ssh is not setup correctly and you will need to resolve the
issue and set up ssh again.
The possible causes for failure could be:
1. The server settings in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file do not allow ssh
for user root.
2. The server may have disabled public key based authentication.
3. The client public key on the server may be outdated.
4. ~root or ~root/.ssh on the remote host may not be owned by root.
5. User may not have passed -shared option for shared remote users or
may be passing the -shared option for non-shared remote users.
6. If there is output in addition to the date, but no password is asked,
it may be a security alert shown as part of company policy. Append the
additional text to the <OMS HOME>/sysman/prov/resources/ignoreMessages.txt file.
